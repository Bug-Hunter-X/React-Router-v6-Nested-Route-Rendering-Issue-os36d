This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes in React Router v6.  The problem involves nested routes failing to render correctly, even when the routes are properly defined. The solution provided addresses this by ensuring the parent route's element is correctly set up to render child routes and that the routes are nested correctly within the parent route.
